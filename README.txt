This project is aimed to read and analyse CIFAR-10 dataset, and create a CNN model to categorise a image in one of the given 10 categories.
About dataset
 1) contains 60k images in rgb format with size 32X32 pixel.
     2) dataset is devided in 10 distinct classes namely (airplae, automobile,bird,cat,deer,dog,frog,horse,ship,truck)
    3) train:test=50k:10K
Steps
    1) Exploratory data anlysis
    2) Data preporcessing
    3) Design a CNN using keras framework
    4) Visualise models learning performance
    5) Model Evaluation
    6) Real world evaluation
